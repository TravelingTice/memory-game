# Memory Game Project v1.0

## How to play

Find all the matching cards by clicking on them and seeing the different cards! When you find a match it will stay flipped. Try to finish the game as fast and with as little moves as possible!

## Setup

1. The board gets generated (all cards are shuffled upon refresh).
2. When 2 cards are clicked, a match check function gets triggered which compares the content of the two cards.
3. When the cards match, they will stay flipped. When not, they will flip again after 1.5 sec.
4. When you finish the game an end screen will be generated, where the time, amount of moves and rating are displayed.

## Properties

- This project is part the Udacity course of _Web Development_.
- The board has a 4x4 grid layout.
- Part of the project has been made by the people at Udacity. I did most of the programming and all of the JavaScript code writing.

## Features that might be added in the future

- An intro screen
- Card flip animations
- Sound effects
- A leaderboard in the end screen
